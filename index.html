<h1>SorenWafflez: An Art Page</h1>
<p>Welcome! I am Soren, I am an artist on Instagram.com. I draw tradtional art on this site. I do not take commissions as I am not old enough for a PayPal, but I will take art trades and requests if they are opened.
  -I have been drawing seriously for around two and a half years. 
  -I have taken no art classes or lessons. 
  -If you would like me to draw something to post, please private message me through the Instagram app, or email me using the email that is on my page.
